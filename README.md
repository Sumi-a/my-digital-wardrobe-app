# ðŸ‘— My Digital Wardrobe

Welcome to **My Digital Wardrobe** â€” a mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native that helps users upload, categorize, and mix-and-match clothing items to create and save stylish outfits.

This app was created as part of an independent study project exploring fashion-tech, UX/UI design, and Firebase integration.

##  Features

- **Image Uploading**: Add images of your clothing items from your device.
- **Categorization**: Manually sort items into "Tops" and "Bottoms" for easy outfit creation.
- **Outfit Builder**: Swipe through your wardrobe to create outfit combinations.
- **Outfit Saving**: Save favorite combinations like a digital outfit camera roll.
- **Firebase Backend**: Secure image storage and user-specific data handling using Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, swipe-friendly interface designed with accessibility and visual clarity in mind.

##  Firebase Setup
To use Firebase services, configure your Firebase project and update firebase.js with your credentials.

 **This app uses:**

- **Firebase Authentication** (email/password login)
- **Firestore Database** (for storing outfit metadata and user info)
- **Firebase Storage** (for image uploads)

Make sure Firestore rules are set up to secure user-specific data access.

## User Testing
 **User testing was conducted using:**

- A sample wardrobe of 3 tops and 3 bottoms
- Images sourced from Pinterest
- On-device testing with Expo Go

 ##  Future Enhancements
- Add support for more categories (e.g., coats, jackets, accessories)
- Integrate machine learning for automatic categorization
- Launch a web version of the app
- Add personalization features like outfit suggestions and user preferences
